# CodeAndResource
This project is mainly focus on the edge detection algorithm which are mainly code:
- EdgeFinderV4.py
- ImageFrame.py

Other codes are testing the algorithm, debuging the runtime and performance working on images in <TestingImagse>.
  
Application concept also here in <main.py> which use <controll_angle_function.py> <MAFilter.py> and <hardwareControl.py> as supporting functions.
 
*<MAfilter.py> is Moving average filter that we are using for simple filtering the angle, so there won't be any sharp changes.
